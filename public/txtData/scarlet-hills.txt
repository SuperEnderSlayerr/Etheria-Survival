Kael Frostwind casts Mirror Image!
Kael Frostwind
**Effect**: Mirror Image One [10 rounds]
**Effect**: Mirror Image Two [10 rounds]
**Effect**: Mirror Image Three [10 rounds]
Effect
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

Effect
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

Kael Frostwind casts Eldritch Blast!
HP1
**To Hit**: 1d20 (9) + 4 = `13`
**Miss!**
Effect
A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

Kael Frostwind casts Shatter!
Meta
**Damage**: 3d8 (4, **8**, 4) [thunder] = `16`
**DC**: 12
HP1
**CON Save**: 1d20 (10) + 4 = `14`; Success!
**Damage**: (16) / 2 [magical thunder] = `8`
Effect
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

Kael Frostwind
**To Hit**: Automatic miss!
**Miss!**
Effect
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of each of the poisoned target's turns, it must repeat the save, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save, or ending the effect on itself on a successful one.
Mirror Image (Kael Frostwind)
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
Mirror Image Targeted (Kael Frostwind)
Mirror Check: 1d20 (6) = `6`
A mirror image was targeted forcing the attack to miss. The duplicate is destroyed with an attack roll higher than 11. Use `!mirror -t target` to remove a duplicate.

(Ignore this if damage based on a saving throw or non-attack roll)

**Damage**: 1d10 (**10**) [magical force] = `10`
Effect
A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

Kael Frostwind casts Eldritch Blast!
MI1
**To Hit**: 1d20 (14) + 4 = `18`
**Damage**: 1d10 (8) [magical force] = `8`
Effect
A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.

Meta
**DC**: 11
FDO1
**Effect**: Euphoria Breath Used (Recharge Euphoria Breath)
Tik
**WIS Save**: 1d20 (15) + 3 = `18`; Success!
Effect
The dragon exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a d6 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:
**1‚Äì4.** The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.
**5‚Äì6.** The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Unconscious (Tik)
Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature must reroll the d20 and use the lower roll.

You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.

Edelweiss casts Chill Touch!
Edelweiss
**Effect**: Chilling Touch [until start of next turn]
PD1
**To Hit**: 1d20 (4) + 4 = `8`
**Miss!**
Effect
You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.

If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Edelweiss uses Metamagic - Twinned Spell!
Effect
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.

Effect
Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

Katherine Wright casts Silvery Barbs!
Effect
You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature must reroll the d20 and use the lower roll.

You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.

**WIS Save**: 1d20 (9) + 2 = `11`; Failure!
**Damage**: 13 [magical psychic] = `13`
Effect
You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

**Damage**: 16 [magical necrotic] + 3 [magical cold] = `19`
**Effect**: No Reactions (Arms of Hadar) [until start of next turn]
Effect
You invoke the power of Hadar, the Dark Hunger. Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and can't take reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect.
At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

Sean uses Tomb of Levistus!
Sean
**THP**: 10 * 5 = `50`
**Effect**: Tomb of Levistus [until end of turn] (Vulnerability: fire)
Effect
As a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in ice, which melts away at the end of your next turn. You gain 10 temporary hit points per warlock level, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible. Immediately after you take the damage, you gain vulnerability to fire damage, your speed is reduced to 0, and you are incapacitated. These effects, including any remaining temporary hit points, all end when the ice melts.

Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Katherine Wright casts Dissonant Whispers!
Meta
**Damage**: 3d6 (4, **1**, 4) [psychic] + 1d6 (4) [psychic] = `13`
**DC**: 13
QU1
**WIS Save**: 1d20 (11) + 1 = `12`; Failure!
**Damage**: 13 [magical psychic] = `13`
Effect
You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.
At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
Spell Slots

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

Owen Finch uses Bear Rage!
Owen Finch
**Effect**: Rage [10 rounds] (Check Advantage: Strength; Save Advantage: Strength; Resistance: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, thunder, necrotic, fire, force, lightning, cold, poison, radiant, acid; End Rage)
Effect
On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

**Bear.** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

Anellia uses Starry Form: Archer!
Meta
**To Hit**: 1d20 (6) + 5 = `11`
**Damage**: 1d8 (6) + 3 [radiant] = `9`
Anellia
**Effect**: Starry Form [10.0 minutes] (Bonus Action: Luminous Arrow)
Effect
As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.
Effect
**Archer.** A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

Chimere Bellerose uses Bladesong!
Chimere Bellerose
**Effect**: Bladesong [10 rounds] (AC Bonus: 3; Check Advantage: Acrobatics; End Bladesong)
Effect
You can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
- You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
- You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

Chimere Bellerose casts Shadow Blade!
Chimere Bellerose
**Effect**: Blade of Shadow [10 rounds] (Attack: Shadow Blade; Parent: Shadow Blade)
Effect
You weave together threads of shadow to create a sword of solidified gloom in your hand. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d8 psychic damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60). In addition, when you use the sword to attack a target that is in dim light or darkness, you make the attack roll with advantage.

If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.

Keres casts Light!
Meta
**DC**: 9
DEX Save
**Effect**: Light
Effect
You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.

Find Familiar
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

[...]
Anellia
**Effect**: Wild Companion
Effect
You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the find familiar spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.

KO5
**DEX Save**: 1d20 (10) + 2 = `12`; Failure!
**Damage**: 27 [magical lightning] = `27`
Effect
A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.

Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.

Kimmian Stowe Dodges!
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.
Kimmian Stowe
**Effect**: Dodge [until start of next turn] (Save Advantage: Dexterity)

A Psurlon Ringer casts Suggestion!
Meta
**DC**: 13
Kimmian Stowe
**WIS Save**: 1d20 (6) + 6 = `12`; Failure!
**Effect**: Charmed (Suggestion) [8.0 hours]
Effect
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
Effect
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

Phalomir Heligton manifests an echo of themselves!
You can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action,until you manifest another echo, or until you‚Äôre incapacitated.
Echo Stats
Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

**Bonus**: 1d8 (**8**) [psionic] = `8`
Effect
When your nonpsionic training fails you, your psionic power can help: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.

*After the battle is over, Libby stretches, each of her joints popping loudly as she realigns them on her way back down to the ground. When her feet touch down, the rune on her chest stops glowing and she shrinks back down below everyone else's height. She gives a proud thumbs up to Blaze.*

Drath Ryiku casts Zone of Truth!
Meta
**DC**: 14
CHA Save
**Effect**: Cannot Lie (Zone of Truth)
Effect
You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.

*As he glances down at the city of Ashfall in the distance, his smile becomes more of a malicious grin.* "Here I come, ready or not." *And he slowly begins his descent.*

Drath Ryiku casts Mold Earth!
Description
You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

Drath Ryiku uses Shell Defense: Withdraw!
Drath Ryiku
**Effect**: Shell Defense (AC Bonus: 4; Save Advantage: Strength, Constitution; Save Disadvantage: Dexterity; Emerge from Shell)

[7/7/2024 10:00 AM] Youla Yesnala
"r.. revivify .. I don't know if I can give you that ability..." 
*Stammering a bit 
She pulls out a bit of parchment and reads through it*
"Can I do that?"


[7/7/2024 10:02 AM] Nixi Notta
"I can do it myself, I just need you to lay back and let me meet the requirements to do so" *she traces her finger up youlas arm and than drags them across her neck gently* "Thats my first wish, my second wish will come shortly after"


[7/7/2024 10:03 AM] Youla Yesnala

"As...as you wish."

"Like this?"

*She hesitates*


[7/7/2024 10:26 AM] Nixi Notta
"Don't worry, I'm not all that bossy, I'll even give all my orders right now" *she boops her nose, her entire demeanor has gone from matter of fact to downright cheerful now that she's gotten a kill and collected a charm today* "Order number 1 Don't tell anyone about what happened out her, our little secret, Order number two, keep that scar for me and even if I dissapear never forget me, Order number 3 you're my friend now, or minion....or slave whatever you want to call it okie dokie?"


[7/7/2024 10:31 AM] Youla Yesnala
*pretty shocked from what just happened*

"Okie... Dokie.." 
*Not the most surprising thing that has happened to her but definitely makes a list*

*She blinks at you a few times*
"So this never happened, you're now master, and I have to keep the scar. As You wish master!" 
*suddenly becomes her normal self in the last sentence as if she's perhaps been through this before*


[7/7/2024 10:32 AM] Nixi Notta
"You got it" *she winks and than finally dismounts offering her hand to help Youla up, even helps dust her off, now that Youla is her first victim...kinda of a point of pride to make sure she's clean....you know serial killer stuff*


[7/7/2024 10:33 AM] Youla Yesnala
"now that I have fulfilled both your wishes I would typically be free to go but now that you are master I now have to ask if there is anything else you need."


[7/7/2024 10:36 AM] Nixi Notta
"You're free to do as you wish when I'm not around" *she'll take the ring out of her pocket and slip it back on Youlas ring* "But right now I just want to make sure you're clean and properly fed, gotta take care of my first victim of course" *reaches up and wipes some of the blood from behind her ear off with her thumb and than stuffs the thumb in her own mouth* "Mmm" *pop as she pulls it out* "Maybe I should find more Genasi, collect all four? Do you know if any others are in town?"


[7/7/2024 10:39 AM] Youla Yesnala
"oh yeah for sure there was a water guy at the hearth. He works behind the counter. He's kind of cute. "
*She stands there with her hands behind her back smiling genuinely*
"I hope that helps out."


[7/7/2024 10:40 AM] Nixi Notta
"Perfect" *she smiles genuinely at Youla as well and than takes her hands this time gently, and will slowly guide her back to town instead of dragging, every movement seems slightly more careful as if Youla is a doll she doesn't want to break*

Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.

You magically twist space around another creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (the target can choose to fail), or the target is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.

Guidance
Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.

Zeck Borphis casts Mold Earth!
Description
You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

Zeck Borphis goes foraging!
Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.
You found a good growing spot!

Checking for safety... it's safe to eat!

You found a good growing spot!

Ben're Eagle-born casts Speak with Animals!
Description
You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM's discretion.

Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.
You found a good growing spot!

Monica goes foraging!
Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.
You couldn't find anything!
