Kael Frostwind casts Mage Armor!
Kael Frostwind
**Effect**: Mage Armor [8.0 hours] (AC Bonus: 3)
Effect
You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

Effect
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

Kael Frostwind attacks with a Net!
SoIS1
**To Hit**: 1d20 (17) + 1 = `18`
**Damage**: (0 [bludgeoning]) / 2 = `0`
Effect
Proficiency with a net allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.


A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.


When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

**To Hit**: 1d20 (6) + 4 = `10`
**Miss!**
Effect
A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

Kael Frostwind casts Eldritch Blast!
SoIS1
**To Hit**: 1d20 (17) + 4 = `21`
**Damage**: 1d10 (5) [magical force] = `5`
Effect
A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

Kael Frostwind
**Effect**: Mage Armor [8.0 hours] (AC Bonus: 3)
Effect
You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

Anellia uses Starry Form: Archer!
Meta
**To Hit**: 1d20 (19) + 5 = `24`
**Damage**: 1d8 (**8**) + 3 [radiant] = `11`
Anellia
**Effect**: Starry Form [10.0 minutes] (Bonus Action: Luminous Arrow)
Effect
As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.
Effect
**Archer.** A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

Kael Frostwind casts Eldritch Blast!
GE1
**To Hit**: 1d20 (16) + 6 = `22`
**Damage**: 1d10 (2) [magical force] = `2`
Effect
A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

Anellia calls forth a Healing Spirit!
Anellia
**Effect**: Heals Expended [9 rounds] (Parent: Healing Spirits)
Anellia
**Healing**: -(1d6 (**6**)) [magical heal] = `-6`
Effect
You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

Owen Finch uses Bear Rage!
Owen Finch
**Effect**: Rage [10 rounds] (Save Advantage: Strength; Resistance: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, thunder, necrotic, fire, force, lightning, cold, poison, radiant, acid; Check Advantage: Strength; End Rage)
Effect
On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

**Bear.** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

Anellia uses Starry Form: Chalice!
Anellia
**Effect**: Starry Form (Special: Restorative Chalice)
Effect
As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.
Effect
**Chalice.** A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

**To Hit**: 1d20 (7) + 7 = `14`

Effect
You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. Each of these appendages is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

Anellia casts Healing Spirit!
Anellia
**Effect**: Healing Spirits [10 rounds] (Attack: Healing Spirit; Parent: Healing Spirit)
Effect
You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals 1d8 extra damage when you hit a creature within 10 feet of you.

Owen Finch
**Effect**: Rage [10 rounds] (Save Advantage: Strength; Resistance: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, thunder, necrotic, fire, force, lightning, cold, poison, radiant, acid; Check Advantage: Strength; End Rage)
Effect
On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

**Bear.** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

Anellia calls forth a Healing Spirit!
Anellia
**Effect**: Heals Expended [9 rounds] (Parent: Healing Spirits)
Ryanora Bartrim
**Healing**: -(1d6 (2)) [magical heal] = `-2`
Effect
You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

Anellia calls forth a Healing Spirit!
Anellia
**Effect**: Heals Expended [8 rounds] (Parent: Healing Spirits)
Owen Finch
**Healing**: -(1d6 (3)) [magical heal] = `-3`
Effect
You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

Owen Finch uses Grappling Appendages!
AE1
**To Hit**: 2d20kh1 (**20**, ~~4~~) + 7 = `27`
**Damage (CRIT!)**: 2d6 (**1**, **1**) + 4 [bludgeoning] = `6`
Effect
You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. Each of these appendages is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
Guiding Bolt (AE1)
The next Attack roll made against this target before the end of the guiding bolt caster's next turn has advantage

**__Total Damage__**: -10
Effect
You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

RDW1
**To Hit**: 1d20 (4) + 7 = `11`
**Miss!**
Effect
You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. Each of these appendages is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

Owen Finch tries to Grapple!
RDW1
**Athletics Contest (Owen Finch)**: 2d20kh1 (~~4~~, 19) + 7 = `26`; Win!
**Athletics Check (RDW1)**: 1d20 (8) + 4 = `12`; Lose!
**Effect**: Grappled (Escape Grapple)
Owen Finch
**Effect**: Grappling (Release Grapple; Parent: Grappled)
Effect
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you‚Äôre able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target‚Äôs Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

Owen Finch uses Grappling Appendages!
SM1
**To Hit**: 1d20 (10) + 7 = `17`
**Damage**: 1d6 (3) + 4 [bludgeoning] = `7`
Effect
You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. Each of these appendages is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

Owen Finch
**Effect**: Rage [10 rounds] (Save Advantage: Strength; Resistance: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, thunder, necrotic, fire, force, lightning, cold, poison, radiant, acid; Check Advantage: Strength; End Rage)
Effect
On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

**Bear.** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

Owen Finch goes foraging!
Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.

*After a few hours of following the map and travelling surprisingly in silence, Mars is able to see in the distance, up on a cliff top, a small mansion complete with turrets and plain red, blue and gold flags. Most of it is surrounded by a wall and gate, but some of it opens up over the cliff and the vast valley below.*

"easy big guy, just here on business from Magnus of the sparks." *He holds up the scroll and moves slowly to hand it over. No visible weapons on him either.* "I am unarmed."

"Magnus of the Sparks. Oh! You're here for the Lady Sorenson then? His lordship has been expecting you. He'll be glad to know someone has finally come." *The guard puts away his blade after looking over the scroll and nods to someone unseen.

Marri Jenii manifests an echo of themselves!
You can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action,until you manifest another echo, or until you‚Äôre incapacitated.
Echo Stats
Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.

Hagnaron goes foraging!
Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.

Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.

Error evaluating expression: Seems like you forgot to include an argument to determine type of hunting, your server's bot gurus have disabled lathe hunting, or you've used an invalid argument. Please contact them to correct this. They can check `!svar HuntArgs`, `!svar HuntSpeciesSmall`, `!svar HuntSpeciesBig`, and/or `!svar HuntSpeciesAquatic` to fix it.

Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.
You found a good growing spot!

You found a good growing spot!

Nokimi Starveil goes foraging!

Astron goes foraging!
Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.
You couldn't find anything!
