Vladimir RinShu goes foraging!
Foraging isn't quite as simple as just walking out to a garden and picking some food off the ground. You have to find where food is growing in the wild, you have to make sure that it's safe food, and you have decide whether or not it's adequately ripe enough to eat.
You found a good growing spot!
**DC 10**
**Athletics:** 1d20 (5) + 7 = `12`
You end up coming across: **Nuts**
Checking for safety... you can't be certain it's safe!
**DC 20**
**Insight:** 1d20 (**1**) + 2 = `3`
